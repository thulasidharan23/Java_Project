Tic-Tac-Toe Game

How to Play

Compile the Java source code using javac Tic_tac.java.
Run the compiled program using java Tic_tac.
The game starts with X playing first.
Enter a slot number (1 to 9) to place your mark.
The game continues until there is a winner or a draw.
The winner is announced, or itâ€™s a draw if no more moves are possible.
